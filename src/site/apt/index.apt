Maven Easyb Plugin

  The Maven Easyb Plugin can be used to execute easyb stories and behaviors during the test lifecycle of a Maven build.
  It can also optionally be used to create HTML representations of your easyb stories effectively allowing requirement
  documentation to be generated from the stories definitions themselves.

  Full documentation of this plugin can be found on the {{{plugin-info.html}goals page}}\
  Also, example usages can be seen on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}
